TRUE

The given problem is to determine if John Archer is an ancestor. To solve this, we need to understand the relationships and the structure provided in the ontology.

1. **Understanding the Ontology Structure**: The ontology includes classes and properties that define relationships between individuals. The property ""Is Ancestor Of"" is crucial as it defines a person's ancestral relationship to another.

2.
