This means if Individual53 is related to another individual by Property12, then that individual is also related to Individual53 by Property12.

The reasoning is based on the fact that Property12 is described as symmetric. This means that if Individual146 is related to any individual by Property12, then that individual is also related to Individual146 by Property12.

The reasoning is based on the fact that Property30 is described as symmetric. This means if Individual41 is related to some individual by Property30, then that individual is also related to Individual41 by Property30. Since Property30 is also stated to be transitive and Individual41 is related to itself by this property (due to symmetry), it can be inferred that Individual41 is related to Individual41 by Property30.
